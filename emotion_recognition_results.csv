34,1,,"The score is in a minor key (E minor) and contains many repeated, rhythmic patterns that suggest a lively, dance‑like feel. The overall texture is energetic and the melodic lines move quickly, giving a sense of high arousal. While the minor tonality can imply a darker mood, the driving rhythm and frequent chordal accompaniment lean more toward an upbeat, spirited character rather than a calm or sorrowful one.

**Most probable emotional label:** **Q1 – happy (high valence, high arousal)**."
