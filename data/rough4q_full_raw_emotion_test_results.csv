Valence Classification: LOW
  Reasoning: The song is written in a minor key (Db) and features slow and contemplative rhythms (1/8, 1/4=90), which often evoke feelings of sadness or melancholy. | The piece is written in the key of Db, which is often associated with somber or melancholic moods. Additionally, the use of fermatas and slower time signatures (6/8 and 9/8) may contribute to a more contemplative or sorrowful atmosphere. | The key of Db and the use of minor chords, combined with the fermata (pause) and the slow tempo (Q:1/4=90), create a somber and melancholic atmosphere.
