Arousal Classification: LOW
  Reasoning: The score primarily consists of long note values and sustained tones, particularly quarter and half notes given the 1/16 default length. The melodic motion is generally stepwise or with small leaps, and the texture appears relatively sparse with few instances of dense chords or rapid figurations. The range is also fairly contained, without extreme registral jumps. | The score features predominantly long note values and sustained tones, especially given the 1/16 default note length. There's a slow-moving quality with few rapid changes per bar, and the texture is generally sparse with clear space between events, despite some chords. The registral range is relatively narrow, with motion mostly contained within a limited span. | The score features predominantly long note values and sustained tones, with a focus on stepwise motion and limited rhythmic density. The texture is generally sparse, and while there are some leaps, they don’t occur frequently enough to suggest high arousal; instead, the melodic lines move relatively gently. The range is moderate, without extreme registral activity.

Valence Classification: LOW
  Reasoning: The piece features predominantly descending melodic contours and a heavy focus on the low register, particularly with repeated low D and G notes. The harmony relies on minor tonality and includes frequent chromaticism and unresolved tensions, creating a dark and somber color, rather than a bright or uplifting one. While there are some upward gestures, they are often brief and followed by descending phrases, reinforcing the overall sense of gloom. | The piece relies heavily on dark, low-register harmonies and descending melodic lines, creating a somber mood. Frequent use of minor tonality and intervals, alongside a generally downward contour, contribute to a sense of weight and tension, particularly in the opening and closing phrases. While there are occasional upward gestures, they are often brief and do not overcome the prevailing darkness. | The piece features predominantly descending melodic lines and a heavy focus on the lower register, creating a dark and somber feel. The harmony relies on repeated, stable but melancholic chords in a minor key, and the frequent use of low D and C notes contributes to a sense of weight and gloom. While not overtly dissonant, the harmonic progressions lack significant upward resolution or brightness.

Combined Result: LOW arousal + LOW valence → Q3 (sad)

Arousal Classification: LOW
  Reasoning: The score consists primarily of longer note values (eighth notes and longer) with relatively few very short notes, creating a slow-moving feel. The texture is generally sparse, with few instances of multiple notes sounding simultaneously, and the melodic motion is largely stepwise or with small leaps, resulting in limited registral activity. | The score features predominantly long note values and sustained tones, especially given the 1/16 default note length and frequent use of notes tied over multiple beats. There is a generally slow-moving, stepwise motion with limited rapid figurations, and the texture is often sparse with clear space between phrases. While there are some leaps, they don't occur frequently enough to suggest high arousal. | The score is characterized by predominantly long note values and sustained tones, particularly with the use of the '2' length indicator. There’s a slow-moving, stepwise motion in many of the lines, and while there are some repeated figures, they don’t create a sense of high energy. The texture is generally sparse, with space between phrases, and the registral range is relatively contained.

Valence Classification: LOW
  Reasoning: The piece features frequent use of minor harmonies and descending melodic lines, creating a generally somber feel. The register is predominantly low, with a focus on the bass clef and lower octaves, contributing to a dark and weighty texture. While there are occasional upward gestures, they are often followed by downward motion, preventing a sense of sustained brightness. | The piece features frequent chromaticism and dissonant intervals, particularly in the use of lowered 7ths and augmented seconds, creating harmonic tension. The melodic contour is largely descending or static, with many phrases ending on lower notes, contributing to a sense of weight and sadness. While there are some higher register notes, the overall focus remains in the lower and mid-registers, reinforcing the dark and somber character. | The harmony relies heavily on repeated, close-position dyads and chords in the lower register, creating a dark and somewhat claustrophobic sound. Melodic contours are largely descending or static, with few soaring gestures, and the frequent use of low notes (F,, A,, B,,) contributes to a sense of weight and gloominess. While there are some brighter moments, the overall impression is one of tension and unresolved harmonic motion.

Valence Classification: LOW
  Reasoning: The harmony features frequent chromaticism and unstable intervals, creating a tense color, particularly with the use of accidentals and diminished-sounding chords. The melodic contour is largely descending or static, with few sustained upward gestures, and the register is often focused in the lower to mid-range, contributing to a darker overall feel. While there are some brighter moments, the pervasive harmonic tension and downward motion suggest a predominantly low valence. | The piece features frequent chromaticism and dissonant intervals, creating harmonic tension—for example, the use of accidentals and chords like <d2[e2A,2]. The melodic contour often descends or remains static in a low register, and while there are some upward gestures, they are often brief and followed by downward movement, contributing to a sense of weight. The prevalence of notes in the lower and mid-low registers, combined with the harmonic instability, suggests a generally dark and tense character. | The piece features frequent chromaticism and dissonant intervals, creating harmonic tension, particularly with the use of accidentals and chords like diminished triads. The melodic contour often descends or remains static in the lower register, contributing to a sense of weight and gloom, and the register is heavily focused on the lower and mid-range, avoiding bright, soaring high notes. These elements combine to suggest a predominantly low valence.
